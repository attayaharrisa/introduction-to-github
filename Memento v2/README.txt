-Completed better animation on the card, able to take information in and retain it until the next page load
-Added non-functional library page, need to figure out how to retain data better before this works the way I want it to

To Do:
-Tidy up images
-Use Typescript instead of Javascript
-Figure out how to keep data after page reload
-Continue to work on other pages


Currently in order to run this web page the steps are as follows:
-Download folder "Memento v2"
-Run home.html in any browser on local machine
-Done!

Hopefully by the next deliverable, there will be a more thorough build process needed.
